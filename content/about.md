My name is Gunnar Aas. <br/>

I'm originally from Duluth, MN, now living Minneapolis, MN. I spend every day putting energy into my passion of using smart public policy and thoughtful applications of technology to solve the problems in our world today. <br/>

I have a background in community organizing, electoral politics, nonprofit leadership and governance, policy development, and advocacy. <br/>

I am a CompTIA A+ certified IT professional with an interest in system deployment, end-user education, and working with non-profit leaders and small business owners to determine and implement the most appropriate and cost effective technology solutions. <br/>

I'm available for full and part time work in the Twin Cities metro area and remotely. Please send any inquiries via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/gunnaraas), or via email to gunnar at gunnaraas.com. <br/>
