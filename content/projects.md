Here is a list of projects I am, or have, worked with. Mostly published here to keep track of everything.

# Community Service Projects

## Sensible Change Minnesota
Launched a 501(c)4 affiliate to Sensible Minnesota in late 2018. Currently serving as Treasurer to the Board of Directors. My primary responsibility with this organization is fundraising and donor relations, however, I also assist with digital content creation and spend time lobbying on behalf of the organization at the Minnesota State Capital.

## Sensible Minnesota
I started volunteering with Sensible Minnesota in early 2017. Over the summer of 2017, I served as the organizations "Community Outreach Intern". After the completion of my internship, I was elected to the Board of Directors, where I first served as Secretary before being promoted to Vice President in the winter of 2018.

# Tech Projects

## QuinLED Dig-Uno 
I've been playing with the [QuinLED Dig-Uno](https://quinled.info/2018/09/15/quinled-dig-uno/) board trying to automate individually addressable LED light strips throughout my home. First time working with circuit boards, soldering, etc. It's a work in progress but I'm learning a lot and having fun with it! Will maybe have a blog written when it's closer to completion. 

# Defunct Projects

## Hamline University Students for Sensible Drug Policy
I started a chapter of Students for Sensible Drug Policy my freshman year at Hamline University, and continued to be involved within this organization throughout the entirety of my time as a student there. The organization went defunct for a short period of time, but is starting to be revived by a new student.
