## About 
With the holidays fast approaching, I'm frustrated that Amazon wishlists are the only easy-to-use option for sharing gift ideas. Many of the things I want or need don't really justify linking to a product listing at a specific site (I know, I'm impossible to shop for). Instead, this page lists things I want but haven't purchased for myself. I'll try to keep this updated occasionally. 

### Emoji Key 
- :dollar: less than $40 <br>
- :dollar::dollar: $40-100 <br>
- :dollar::dollar::dollar: $100+ <br>
- :moneybag::moneybag::moneybag: I want this but would feel guilty if someone spent this much on me. 

# Computer Equipment 

### :dollar: Case fans 
I'm trying to get rid of all the unnecessary lighting in my computer, the biggest thing being my red LED case fans. I like my computer to be as quiet as possible. A couple [120mm Noctua case fans](https://noctua.at/en/products/fan) would be awesome (especially the limited edition black ones) 

### :dollar::dollar: New Mouse <br>
I want a new wired mouse that doesn't light up the room with bright, unnecessary lighting. I like a heavy, adjustable weight mouse with an ergonomic grip. Logitech's gaming mice (like a [G502 Hero](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g502-hero-gaming-mouse.910-005469.html)) would be rad. 

### :dollar::dollar: Keycaps 
I'd like a set of artisan keycaps. Nothing specific, since they're usually small batch. [Drop.com](https://drop.com/) is a good site for finding these. I like ones without letters, that have a super key instead of a Window key, or a Hiragana layout. My primary mechanical keyboard is a standard 82-key. 

### :dollar::dollar::dollar: DIY Mechanical Keyboard
[Drop.com](https://drop.com) also has some kits available for building a mechanical keyboard by hand. I'd be super interested in one of these. 

### :dollar::dollar::dollar: Storage 
I'm in constant need of more storage space. SSDs ([Samsung 860 or 970](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/)) of 1TB or higher are useful for my day-to-day computing. Large HDDs (like the [10-12TB Western Digital EasyStores](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/wd-easystore-12tb-external-usb-3-0-hard-drive-black/6425301.p?skuId=6425301)) would be really useful for the data hording home server I want to build within next year. 

### :moneybag::moneybag::moneybag: Monitor 
I want to eventually upgrade to a Super-Ultrawide UHD monitor like the [Samsung Odyssey G9](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/49-odyssey-g9-gaming-monitor-lc49g97tssnxdc/). Don't buy me this. 

# Electronics 

### :dollar: electronic / tinkerer parts 
I want to build a [Quinled Dig Uno](https://quinled.info/2020/05/08/quinled-dig-uno-hardware-guide-2/) board, but need a lot of the things on the hardware guide. 
I have the: <br>
- Quinled Dig Uno PCB <br>
- Wemos D1 Mini microprocessor <br>
but need everything else on [this guide](https://quinled.info/2020/05/08/quinled-dig-uno-hardware-guide-2/)

### :dollar::dollar::dollar: 3D printer
3D printing looks really neat and is something I'd like to get into. I haven't done much research into it, but have read that they're all basically the same. I don't think I'd need to print anything larger than 10"x10". 

### :dollar::dollar::dollar: - :moneybag::moneybag::moneybag: upgraded car stereo 
I'd really like to upgrade my car stereo to something that's compatible with Apple CarPlay & Android Auto but has a physical volume knob and satellite radio compatibility. There's some extra parts needed for compatibility with my car (2016 Hyundai Sonata SE).

# Home / Kitchen 

### :dollar: / :dollar::dollar: Pizza Stone 
Had a pizza stone and loved it, but it cracked and broke after a few months of frequent use. Been meaning to replace it, and have not. 

### :dollar::dollar: Automated Indoor Gardening 
I've seen things like this for people like me who are terrible at watering plants. Need to do more research about what exactly I'd like though. DIY or open source is ideal. Something small that lets me have some fresh herbs, maybe some lettuce and onion, year round would be cool. 

### :dollar::dollar::dollar: NanoLeaf lighting panels 
I think [these](https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/nanoleaf-light-panels/) are a really cool art piece, but can't justify spending that much on them. I know they occasionally go on heavy discount at Home Depot and have been waiting for the right sale. 

# Clothing & Accessories 

### :dollar: Warm socks 
Self explanitory. I get holes in most of my nice socks by Christmas time every near and need to replace them. 

### :dollar: Sleep Mask 
I've been wanting something to block out light while I sleep forever but keep forgetting to buy it. Weighted would be cool? 

### :dollar:? Nice Sunglasses
I've only ever owned cheap gas station sunglasses. Would like something with good anti-glare to use while driving. I don't know anything about sunglasses or what makes them good, I just want to not be blinded when driving in the evening. 

### :dollar::dollar: Linus Tech Tips Merch 
Help support my favorite YouTube channel. I would love anything on [their site](https://www.lttstore.com/), and wear a size XL. 

# Books 

### :dollar: Anything you think I'd like to read
I prefer non-fiction, political or political theory books. History is cool too.

### :dollar::dollar: Certification exam study books 
Help me advance my career by getting me some of the cram guides for the exams I plan to take soon. 
The ones I don't have books for are: 
- CompTIA Server+ <br>
- Cisco CCNA <br >
